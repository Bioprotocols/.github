Welcome to the Bioprotocols Community landing page!

![A image showing that LabOP is combined from the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for the Activity model, the Synthetic Biology Open Language (SBOL) for Object model and materials, Aquarium, the Laboratory Operating System for Sample Typing, Autoprotocol for Atomic action libraries, PROV-O (from W3C) for the execution history](/images/LabOP_narrow.png)

An open community developing a free and open standard for representation of biological protocols, which we call the **Lab**oratory **O**pen **P**rotocol language or **LabOP**, formerly known as **PAML**.

Please join our Bioprotocols Google Group, if you would like to see our mailing list, get access to our working documents and slides, or participate in our weekly scrums via Zoom:

Please also see the `collab-bioprotocols` channel on the Bits In Bio Slack to participate in ongoing discussions. (details to join Bits-In-Bio here: [https://bitsinbio.org](https://bitsinbio.org))
